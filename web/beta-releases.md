## About Beta Testing

Apple's beta programs allow admins, and developers and consumers to test pre-release software and provide feedback to Apple before public release.

### Beta Types

#### Developer Beta
- **Access**: Requires Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- **Timing**: Released first, typically at WWDC 
- **Risk**: Breaking changes, more unstable
- **Features**: Access to all beta features and APIs

#### Public Beta
- **Access**: Free through Apple Beta Software Program
- **Timing**: Starts after developer beta, once out, avail cadence is usually few days after developer beta
- **Risk**: Less frequently released, often similar to developer beta
- **Features**: Consumer-focused testing

### Important Considerations

- Cause data loss
- Affect system stability
- Break app compatibility
- Impact battery life
- Reduce performance

### Best Practices
