# Apple Root Certificate
# 
# IMPORTANT: The embedded certificate below is the standard Apple Root CA (2006-2035)
# which is widely compatible. Apple also offers newer certificates (G3, G4) but
# they may not be compatible with all systems due to different algorithms (ECC vs RSA).
#
# To fetch certificates from Apple:
#   1. Use the built-in command: sofa-init fetch-apple-cert
#   2. For G3 (newer ECC): curl -o config/AppleRoot.pem "https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/AppleRootCA-G3.cer"  
#   3. For legacy (old RSA): curl -o config/AppleRoot.pem "https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/AppleComputerRootCertificate.cer"
#   4. Browse all certificates: https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/
#
# NOTE: If you get "badSignature" errors, use the embedded certificate below
# as it's the most widely supported Apple Root CA.
